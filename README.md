Millions of people visit Quora every month, so duplication of question asked is not a surprise, However if we build a model that could identify the duplication of questions being asked then it would provide instant answer to questionaire

Further it would reduce of cost of writting duplicates answer everytime

This is a binary classification problems, for a given pair of question model have to predict the class as duplicate or not
if found duplicate, then answer can be provided instantly.
